## Why github-based resume useful?

It has powerful accessibility (including printability.)

### Education

## Why I design the resume like this?

I want to describe the events which made the biggest impacts on me lately. Through this resume, I will give clues to understand my thoughts why I'm working and the things I think worth.

I thought describing two important events is the most suitable way to achieve this goal. This is why I design the resume like this.

Of course, also wrote down the phrases most important to me.
